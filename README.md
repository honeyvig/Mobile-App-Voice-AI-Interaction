==================
Creating a mobile application like Leo that integrates astrology-based insights with voice AI capabilities requires several technical layers. Below is a detailed Python code outline for key components like user registration, backend astrology engine, voice AI integration, and mobile optimization:
Key Features Breakdown:

    User Registration & Input:
        We’ll use Flask (Python web framework) to handle registration via email or social accounts, as well as processing birth data.
        For secure storage of user data, SQLAlchemy will handle database operations, and password hashing can be done using Werkzeug.

    Astrological Analysis Engine:
        Python libraries like PyEphem or Astronomy can be used to calculate planetary positions and astrological charts.
        You can develop a backend API that processes users' birth data and returns personalized astrological insights.

    Voice AI Interaction:
        Use Google Speech-to-Text or Deepgram for speech recognition and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for voice output.
        Dialogflow or Rasa can be integrated for NLP and AI-driven conversations based on astrological insights.

    Mobile Optimization & TV Integration:
        For mobile apps (iOS/Android), you can use React Native or Flutter for cross-platform support.
        TV optimization will involve creating a responsive UI using larger fonts and simplifying navigation.

    Testing, Iteration, & Continuous Improvement:
        Integration with TestFlight for iOS testing or equivalent platforms will be used for collecting feedback.

Python Code Outline:

Below is an example code structure that combines the features mentioned above, focusing primarily on the backend and voice AI interaction:
1. Flask Backend (User Registration & Astrological Analysis)

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
import ephem
import datetime
import random
import json

# Setup Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Database setup using SQLAlchemy
DATABASE_URL = 'sqlite:///leo_db.sqlite'
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Define the User class for registration
class User:
    def __init__(self, email, password_hash, birth_data):
        self.email = email
        self.password_hash = password_hash
        self.birth_data = birth_data

# User Registration endpoint
@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register_user():
    data = request.json
    email = data.get('email')
    password = data.get('password')
    birth_data = data.get('birth_data')

    password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)
    
    # Store user in database
    new_user = User(email=email, password_hash=password_hash, birth_data=birth_data)
    session.add(new_user)
    session.commit()

    return jsonify({"message": "User registered successfully"}), 201

# Astrological Analysis Engine (example)
@app.route('/generate_chart', methods=['POST'])
def generate_chart():
    data = request.json
    birth_data = data.get('birth_data')

    # Example of calculating zodiac sign based on date
    birth_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(birth_data['birth_date'], '%Y-%m-%d')
    zodiac_sign = get_zodiac_sign(birth_date)

    # Generate some astrological insights (for simplicity)
    insights = {
        "zodiac_sign": zodiac_sign,
        "personality": "You are a strong-willed and passionate individual.",
        "daily_horoscope": "Today will be a day of self-discovery."
    }

    return jsonify(insights)

# Zodiac Sign Determination Logic
def get_zodiac_sign(birth_date):
    # Simple example of zodiac sign based on birth date (not accurate)
    if (birth_date.month == 3 and birth_date.day >= 21) or (birth_date.month == 4 and birth_date.day <= 19):
        return "Aries"
    # Add other zodiac signs similarly...
    return "Unknown"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

    User Registration: This Flask endpoint accepts JSON data for user registration, hashes the password using Werkzeug, and stores the user’s information in an SQLite database.

    Astrological Engine: The /generate_chart endpoint uses the birth data (date) to determine a user’s zodiac sign (basic example) and returns insights based on their astrological profile. More complex logic can be integrated for full natal chart calculations.

2. Voice AI Integration (Google Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech)

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
from google.cloud import dialogflow_v2 as dialogflow
import os

# Google Cloud setup for Dialogflow (Assumes environment variable is set for credentials)
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path_to_your_google_credentials.json"

# Initialize Text-to-Speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Speech Recognition function
def listen_to_user():
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    try:
        print("Recognizing...")
        query = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"User said: {query}")
        return query
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None

# Dialogflow (NLP) Integration for voice interaction
def get_dialogflow_response(text):
    session_client = dialogflow.SessionsClient()
    session = session_client.session_path("your_project_id", "unique_session_id")
    text_input = dialogflow.TextInput(text=text, language_code="en")
    query_input = dialogflow.QueryInput(text=text_input)
    response = session_client.detect_intent(session=session, query_input=query_input)
    return response.query_result.fulfillment_text

# Text-to-Speech output
def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Example of interaction
def interact_with_user():
    query = listen_to_user()
    if query:
        response = get_dialogflow_response(query)
        speak(response)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    interact_with_user()

    Speech Recognition: This Python script listens for user voice input using the SpeechRecognition library and the Google Web Speech API, transcribing it into text.

    Dialogflow (NLP): After recognizing the speech, the system sends it to Dialogflow for natural language processing and gets a response (e.g., astrological readings or daily horoscopes).

    Text-to-Speech: The response is read aloud using pyttsx3, a text-to-speech library.

3. Mobile & TV Optimization

For the mobile application, you'll want to use a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter. Here's a very basic React Native structure for the UI:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
  const [birthDate, setBirthDate] = useState('');

  const handleRegister = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('http://your_backend_url/register', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: email,
        password: password,
        birth_data: { birth_date: birthDate }
      })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    Alert.alert('Registration Status', data.message);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>User Registration</Text>
      <TextInput placeholder="Email" value={email} onChangeText={setEmail} />
      <TextInput placeholder="Password" value={password} onChangeText={setPassword} secureTextEntry />
      <TextInput placeholder="Birth Date (YYYY-MM-DD)" value={birthDate} onChangeText={setBirthDate} />
      <Button title="Register" onPress={handleRegister} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;

This React Native component will create a simple registration page. It can be expanded to include other astrological features and optimized for TV screens by increasing font size and making navigation simpler with arrow keys.
Conclusion:

This Python-based backend code outline provides the essential components to build your astrology-based mobile application, Leo. It covers user registration, the core astrological engine, and AI voice integration. For a full app, you would need to develop more robust logic, integrate with mobile frameworks like React Native for UI, and implement testing via TestFlight or equivalent platforms.
